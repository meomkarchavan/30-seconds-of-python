Print on the same line in console in python 3.

- By default end argument is set to "\n"
- But by seting it to ""(blank) we can make python print on same lines.

```py
print("Value 1 to Print", end="")
print("Value 2 to Print", end="")
```

```py
print("I am line 1.", end="")
print(" I am line 2.", end="")
#I am line 1. I am line 2.
```
