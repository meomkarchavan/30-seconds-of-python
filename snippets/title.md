Make the first letter in each word upper case.

- The `title()` method returns a string where the first character in every word is upper case. Like a header, or a title..
- If the word contains a number or a symbol, the first letter after that will be converted to upper case.

```py
string.title()  
```

```py
message = "hello world, this is a message"
print(message.title())#Hello World, This Is A Message
```
